In this episode, we'll discuss two fundamental data structures in computer science - arrays and linked lists. Their understanding is essential not only in your day to day job but also for performing well on your next coding interview.

We'll discuss implementation details for both data structures, and we'll talk about when it's better to choose one instead of the other. Along the way, we'll touch on memory hierarchy, caching locality, and different interview problems.
