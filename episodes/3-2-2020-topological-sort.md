title: Topological Sort
description: In this episode, you'll learn the topological sort algorithm. Along the way, you'll understand what's a dependency graph and how topological sort operates on this data structure. We'll also discuss a few real-life examples where I had to implement topological sort myself!

The chances are that the information from this episode will come in handy to you during a coding interview and likely in real life!

In this episode, you'll learn the topological sort algorithm. Along the way, you'll understand what's a dependency graph and how topological sort operates on this data structure. We'll also discuss a few real-life examples where I had to implement topological sort myself!
