title: Graphs and Graph Traversal
description: In this episode, we'll discuss graphs. You'll learn how this data structure looks like and what are its applications. Later on, we'll talk about algorithms for traversing graphs. You'll understand how breadth-first search and depth-first search work and when you should use one instead of the other. Topics we'll also touch on are chromatic graphs and finding the shortest path.
