By the end of the episode, you'll understand what these two different concepts are how they are different from each other, and where you can apply them in practice. In between the episode, we'll also talk about the brilliant computer scientist Haskell Curry, and we'll mention the Curry-Howard isomorphism.","audio":"https://feeds.soundcloud.com/stream/743152012-the-programming-podcast-episode-3-partial-application-not-currying.mp3","publish":true},{"route":"/episode/1-4-2020-how-compilers-work","title":"How Compilers Work","description":"In this episode, we discuss how compilers work. By the end of the show, you'll have a high-level understanding of the phases the source code you write goes though before executed!","audio":"https://feeds.soundcloud.com/stream/738933013-the-programming-podcast-episode-1-how-compilers-work.mp3","publish":true},{"route":"/episode/1-5-2020-binary-search","title":"Binary Search","description":"Today we'll discuss the binary search algorithm. We'll go through several examples when the algorithm makes sense and discuss in detail how it works. By the end of the episode, you'll know when to apply a binary search and know why it's more efficient than a linear search.","audio":"https://feeds.soundcloud.com/stream/738933715-the-programming-podcast-episode-2-binary-search.mp3","publish":true},{"route":"/about"}]
