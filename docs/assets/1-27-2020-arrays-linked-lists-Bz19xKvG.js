<p>In this episode, we&#39;ll discuss two fundamental data structures in computer science - arrays and linked lists. Their understanding is essential not only in your day to day job but also for performing well on your next coding interview.</p>
<p>We&#39;ll discuss implementation details for both data structures, and we&#39;ll talk about when it&#39;s better to choose one instead of the other. Along the way, we&#39;ll touch on memory hierarchy, caching locality, and different interview problems.</p>
