Programming is a weekly podcast with Minko Gechev that aims to make us better software engineers! With each new episode, you'll get exposed to a new idea in a brief and accessible way. Listening to the show:

- Will help you understand where you can apply the individual concepts for more elegant and efficient solutions.
- Give you an intuition how complex algorithms and patterns work.
- Help you land your next engineering job by expanding your knowledge.
- Spark your interest for further reading so you can dig deeper and get more detailed understanding

Having a computer science degree is not a requirement for getting value from the "Programming" podcast. If you have one, you'll finally understand how you can use all the math you've studied.

## How to start?

I need to migrate off scully and webpack...but until then:

```bash
nvm use 12
npm i
vim /Users/mgechev/Projects/podcast/node_modules/webpack-dev-server/client/utils/createSocketUrl.js
npm i querystring-es3
# edit querystring to querystring-es3
npm start
```
